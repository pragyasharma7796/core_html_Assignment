            The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is: </p>
            <p>
                Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.<br>
                Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.<br>
                Web Development can be classified into two ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frontend Development</li>
                 <li>   Backend Development</li>
                
            </ul>
                    
            <p>
                Frontend Development<br>
                The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed 
                as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the 
                application.
