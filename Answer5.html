        <dt>LAMP</dt>
        <dd><p>LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models.
             In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance.
             It is an acronym that stands for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linux (operating system)</li>
                <li>Apache (HTTP server)</li>
                <li>MySQL (relational database management)</li>
                <li>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these stack layers are free and open source. Since this tech stack can run on any operating system, you can interchange or modify other components in the same stack. Use WAMP for Microsoft Windows or MAMP for MacOS.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>ASP.NET </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about</p>
            <p>Applications built using .NET commonly use the following application tech stack:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework</li>
                    <li>IIS – Microsoft’s web server</li>
                    <li>Angular frontend framework with TypeScript</li>
                    <li>SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is also very common to also see .NET applications running on Linux with NGINX and open source databases like Postgresql or Mysql.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>MERN</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.</p>
            <p>The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).</p>
            <p>Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>MEVN</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.</p>
            <p>Vue.js is easy to learn, delivers a clear programming style, and provides superb performance for web applications.</p>
